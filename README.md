## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology
Advantages:
Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile is highly adaptable to changes. Requirements can be adjusted throughout the project, allowing for continuous improvement.

Customer Collaboration: Involves regular interactions with stakeholders and customers, ensuring that the final product meets their needs and expectations.

Iterative Development: Work is divided into short iterations (sprints), with each iteration resulting in a potentially shippable product. This allows for early detection and correction of issues.

Faster Delivery: Frequent releases of smaller, incremental updates ensure that features are delivered more quickly.

Enhanced Quality: Continuous testing and feedback during each iteration lead to improved quality and early detection of defects.

Disadvantages:
Less Predictability: The iterative nature can make it challenging to predict timelines, costs, and project scope.

Requires Strong Team Collaboration: Agile relies on close collaboration and communication among team members. It may be less effective with distributed or less cohesive teams.

Documentation Can Be Minimal: Emphasis on working software over comprehensive documentation can lead to incomplete or inconsistent documentation.

Scope Creep Risk: Flexibility can sometimes result in scope creep if changes are not properly managed.

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
Clear Structure and Phases: Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach with defined phases (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance).

Predictability: Fixed project scope, timeline, and budget provide clear expectations and predictability.

Detailed Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is created at each stage, ensuring clear guidelines and reference materials.

Easier to Manage: The straightforward, structured approach makes it easier to manage and track progress, especially for large projects with stable requirements.

Disadvantages:
Inflexibility to Changes: Waterfall is less adaptable to changes. Once a phase is completed, it is difficult to go back and make modifications.

Delayed Testing: Testing is done only after the development phase, which can lead to late detection of defects and higher costs for fixing them.

Longer Delivery Time: Projects are delivered as a whole, which means no working software is available until the end of the project.

Risk of Misalignment: If requirements are not clearly defined or change over time, there is a risk of misalignment between the final product and customer expectations.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile Methodology
Beneficial for:
